<h5>Now</h5>
<p>I recently took a User Experience and User Interface Design course at EDIT - Disruptive Digital Education where I discovered a new passion on the design field. That made me want to learn more about design thinking, human-centered design (at Interaction Design Foundation), and even about Coding (at SheCodes) 👩🏻‍💻.
  I am a product designer, working as a Communication Designer at a Luxury Rugs Company. I'm in charge of the sales product innovation and creation of digital and editorial material, and I'm in charge of the management of the company's brand image.</p>
<br>
<h5>Who am I</h5>
<p>I see myself as an ambitious and curious person, who loves to know all the "why's" and have a significant impact on people's lives. ​​​​​​​I'm also a part-time sportist 🏋🏻‍♀️, traveller and ceramist, that are part of my biggest hobbies and motivations. I'm also a dogs lover. 🐶</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>My past</h5>
<p> It was in high school, while studying  product design at an artistic school where I discovered what design really was all about and fell in love with the design process. Because of that, I decided to take my bachelor at the University of Fine Arts of Lisbon, in Product Design.</p> 
<p>When I finished my bachelor  I really wanted to have my first experience working as a designer (and not as a waitress, hostess ou kickboxing coach anymore) and I applied to an international internship program called INOV contact, where they make a match with our profile and a company, anywhere in world.</p>
<p>I turned out going to Milan, Italy 🇮🇹🍕 To work at the Isao Hosoe Design Studio, where I had the opportunity to participate on the design process of three big projects where two of them where actually developed!</p> 
<p>When I came back to Portugal I decided to start a Product Design Master, which I end up not doing because I had the opportunity to start working as a graphic designer at an events company and I saw that as an opportunity to learn about a different design field. One year later, I had the proposal to work as a communication designer at Ferreira de Sá Rugs. And currently <strong>I'm looking for a new challenge</strong></p>
