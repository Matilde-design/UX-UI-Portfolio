<h5>Now</h5>
<p>I recently took a User Experience and User Interface design course at EDIT - Disruptive Digital Education where I reconected with my passion about creating meaninfull products to improve people lives. I'm currently learning more and more about: design thinking, human-centerd design (at Interaction Design Foundation) and even about Coding (at SheCodes).<br>
I work as a Comunication Designer at a Luxury Rugs Company, since I like to explore all the fields of design. I'm in charge of the sales products innovation and creation, graphic and editorial material and management of the company's brand image.</p>
<br>
<h5>Who am I</h5>
<p>I see myself as an ambitious and curious person, who loves to know all the "why's" and have a significant impact on people's lives. ​​​​​​​I'm also a part-time sportist, traveller, photographer and ceramist, that are part of my biggest hobbies and motivations. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>My past</h5>
<p> When I was a kid, I wanted to be a painter, because I was fascinated about creating things. As I was getting older the idea to create something that could improve people life’s s stared to make sense to me and it was in high school, while studying  product design at an artistic school where I discovered what design really was all about and fall in love with the design process. Because of that, I decided to take my bachelor at the University of Fine Arts of Lisbon, in Equipment Design.</p> 
<p>When I finished my bachelor  I really wanted to have my first experience working as a designer (and not as a waitress, hostess ou kickboxing coach anymore) and I applied to an international internship program called INOV contact, where they make a match with our profile and a company, anywhere in world.</p>
<p>In January 2017 I knew that I was going two weeks after, to Italy to work at the Isao Hosoe Studio, where I had the opportunity to participate on the design process of three big projects for two of the studio main clients of the studio, and two of them where actually developed, what made me very proud.</p> 
<p>When I came back to Portugal I decided to start a Product Design Master, which I end up quitting to start working as a graphic designer at an events company. I wanted to learn more about the different  fields of design, and the master was not making sense to me at that point a view. I was in charge of creating creative proposal not only related to graphics, final arts and special products, but also related to the execution of event itself - decoration, planning, concept. <br> Due to my multidisciplinary past, I had the proposal to work where I am now.</p>
